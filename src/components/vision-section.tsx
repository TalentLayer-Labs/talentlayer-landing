          The most resilient, uncensorable, and accessible systems are user-owned, decentralized,
          and autonomous. Thatâ€™s why TalentLayer was built as a open-source low-level protocol for
          many applications to leverage; like SMTP for email.

          Each year more and more workers find jobs on digital platforms. The &ldquo;great
          unbundling&rdquo; is happening fast - big generalized platforms are being overtaken by
          many niche platforms that serve their user&apos;s unique needs better. TalentLayer is
          empowering this next generation of marketplaces to transform the way people work.

          marketplaces that serve everyone.
